# HistEmo—Resources for Historical Emotion Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the following resources: 
- A gold standard of word-emotion association of German words in the 18th and 19th century manually annotated by several doctoral students of different fields of the humanities.
- An extensive lexicon reflecting word-emotion association of German words in the 18th and 19th century. The lexicon was automatically induced by expanding a contemporary lexicon of this kind and jointly adapting it to that prior language stage.

Emotion is represented following the psychological Valence-Arousal-Dominance model. It assumes that an affective state can be described relative to three emotional dimensions: Valence (the degree of pleasentness or unpleasentness of an emotion), Arousal (degree of calmness or excitement), and Dominance (the degree of perceived control ranging from submissive to dominant).

The resources are in tsv format: The first column holds the lexical entries, the second to forth columns give the respective Valence, Arousal and Dominance values.

Please consult the paper below for details.
