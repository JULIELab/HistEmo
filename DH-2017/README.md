## Overview
This directory contains the resources of our Digital Humanities 2017 paper "The Course of Emotion in Three Centuries of German Text: A Methodological Framework" (see below). This includes (a) the seven semi-automatically constructed emotion lexicons (see "lexicons"), as well as (b) the results of the emotion analysis of our selection of the DTA corpus (see "texts"). The lexicons are stored in tsv format: The first column holds the lexical entries, the second to forth columns give the respective Valence, Arousal and Dominance values.

Generally, we represented emotion following the psychological Valence-Arousal-Dominance model. It assumes that an affective state can be described relative to three emotional dimensions: Valence (the degree of pleasentness or unpleasentness of an emotion), Arousal (degree of calmness or excitement), and Dominance (the degree of perceived control ranging from submissive to dominant).

Please consult the paper below for details.
